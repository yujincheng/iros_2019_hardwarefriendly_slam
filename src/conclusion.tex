Though DSLAM can benefit from CNN, the deployment of CNN on embedded systems faces big challenges. We propose a CNN-based monocular DSLAM system deployed on Xilinx ZU9 MPSoC, and a Pose-Sensitive fixed-point finetune method to balance the accuracy and speed of CNN-based Visual Odometry on embedded FPGA. We also explore the impact of NetVLAD frequency on DSLAM results, and propose a cross-component scheduling method to increase the operating frequency of NetVLAD to improve DSLAM performance.
